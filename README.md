# caret-intro
[Caret](https://topepo.github.io/caret/) (short for Classification And REgression Training) is a comprehensive framework for building machine learning models in R.

This repository contains some practical [examples](https://github.com/francescovetere/caret-intro/tree/main/examples) and a [guide](https://github.com/francescovetere/caret-intro/blob/main/caret-guide.pdf) to introduce the developer to the Caret package: starting from the installation process, it will be then shown how to use Caret to build machine learning models.
Finally, some practical examples of Multi-Layer Perceptrons will be presented.
